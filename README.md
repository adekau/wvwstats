### History mode. 
Potential drop down box at the top of a page where you select a week range from the past and it loads the last archive from the end of that week (9:45 est or 10:00 est). Then have a more detailed history page that you can go to for that match. In that page, have a graph like structure (like the ones in the match details pages) and when you click on a point on the graph (say it's a score one for example) it will display a thing at the bottom like "Selected date: ___ GO TO DATE" and when you click there it changes the match to that specific time.

### Skirmish viewer
Details on this are not ready. Still thinking about how I want to do this. Can say for sure the main match page will no longer display the complete match scores, rather the current skirmish scores.
