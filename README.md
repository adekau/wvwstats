# Future

### History mode. -- WIP (/history)
Potential drop down box at the top of a page where you select a week range from the past and it loads the last archive from the end of that week (9:45 est or 10:00 est). Then have a more detailed history page that you can go to for that match. In that page, have a graph like structure (like the ones in the match details pages) and when you click on a point on the graph (say it's a score one for example) it will display a thing at the bottom like "Selected date: ___ GO TO DATE" and when you click there it changes the match to that specific time.

### Skirmish History
- Add route (WIP -- /skirmishes/:match) to display the history of skirmishes for a week for specific `match`. 
- Be able to view metric data for the skirmish timeframe (k/d values and ratio, etc.)

### Guild Metrics
- When endpoint is available, add page to display guild k/d (search by guild name) and the top k/d & kills list.
